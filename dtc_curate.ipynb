This assay was performed in a 200 l volume in 96-well microtiter plates using cDNA-expressed human hepatic CYP3A4 (supersome, BD Gentest #456202). As a substrate for CYP3A4, 7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (BFC) was used. The compounds of Examples 1 to 5 and the substrate BFC were dissolved in 100% acetonitrile. The final volume of acetonitrile of the incubation mixture was less than 1% (volume/volume). A potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, final concentration 0.1M), MgCl2 (final concentration 8.3 mM), EDTA (final concentration 1.67 mM), an inventive compound stock solution, CYP3A4 supersome, and NADPH (final concentration 0.25 mM) were added to each well. The reaction was initiated by adding the substrate (BFC, final concentration 30 M) at 37. The incubation was performed for 20 minutes and then the reaction was terminated by the addition of 75 ul of acetonitrile: 0.5 M tris-base=4:1 (volume/volume).Then, a fluorescent signal was measured using a fluorometer.',\n",

The inhibition of CYP enzyme activity (IC50) for each of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4(BFC) and CYP3A4(BQ) is determined for compounds, where inhibition of metabolism of a known substrate leads to a decrease in the fluorescence of the metabolized product. The fluorescence of the product is monitored as a function of compound concentration.Compounds are dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 100 mM. These are diluted 1 uL into 82 uL of acetonitrile. An 11 uL aliquot of this solution is then added to 204 uL of cofactor mix (1.3% NADPH Regeneration system Solution A, 1.04% NADPH Regeneration system Solution B from BD Biosciences, 5% acetonitrile and 0.05% DMSO). These are then serially diluted 1:1 (160 uL to 160 uL co-factor mix) for a total of 10 points. A 10 uL aliquot of this final mixture is dispensed into 384 well assay plates.',\n",

Mol. Pharmacol. 36, 89-96 [1989]) and testosterone 6beta -hydroxylase (Waxman, D. J., et al. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 263, 424-436, [1988]). For midazolam hydroxylase determination the final concentrations of microsomal protein and terfenadine substrate were 0.25 mg/mL and 2.5 uM, respectively, and the LC-MS internal standard was 1alpha -hydroxytriazolam. For testosterone hydroxylase activity the final microsomal protein concentration was 0.5 mg/mL, the substrate concentration was 50 uM and the LC-MS internal standard was D7-labeled 6beta -hydroxytestosterone. After incubation at 37 C. for 5 minutes, metabolic reactions were terminated by treatment with quench solution containing the appropriate internal standard.\",\n",

In the design of clinically safe and effective metalloenzyme inhibitors, use of the most appropriate metal-binding group for the particular target and clinical indication is critical. If a weakly binding metal-binding group is utilized, potency may be suboptimal. On the other hand, if a very tightly binding metal-binding group is utilized, selectivity for the target enzyme versus related metalloenzymes may be suboptimal. The lack of optimal selectivity can be a cause for clinical toxicity due to unintended inhibition of these off-target metalloenzymes. One example of such clinical toxicity is the unintended inhibition of human drug metabolizing enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 by the currently-available prostate anticancer agent ketoconazole. It is believed that this off-target inhibition is caused primarily by the indiscriminate binding of the currently utilized 1-imidazole to iron in the active site of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. ',\n",
